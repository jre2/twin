weapon state
    when switch weapons, need to reset certain state of new/old weapon?
    firing inside idle state emits bullet. has separate firing state that should do it

generally better separation for gameplay logic and rendering code
    camera shake decay shouldnt be in weapon update section. vfx should be separate section


cannon timing seems off
    charge hits max charge before sound effect finishes (barely)
    live beam duration too short; cooldown starts while the sound is still in the awesome beam damage phase, before the weird air-vacuum cooldown phase


not only player should have kickback from powerful weapons; enemies too
    rather than pure visual offset, maybe kickback on firing actually moves player a bit? model per frame movement to have it look nice
        impulse based? player can maybe try to counteract with careful movement?


refactor all the asset loading and DB init to separate func for clarity

# meta issues for claude
add custom commands
